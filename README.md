# Virtual Reality Locomotion

Designed a VR application to educate Curators and Museum Directors on the benefits that VR/AR technology can bring to their exhibits. Mixed reality literally makes the possibilities endless and this application will guide the user through a small exhibit floor showcasing some of the capabilities and current-day applications of VR.

## Introduction of VR Concepts in Museum
* Constructive shifts in visitor behaviour and expectations and demands and that comes with a generation that is growing up with changing technology.
* AR and VR or any 3D based experience are additional end-point in the future 
* Technology is increasingly catching up with the ‘vision’ and becoming more affordable - better computer screen , head-mounted devices , VR goggles 
* VR will become an effective tool in holistic story-telling and ability to convey a true first-person view
* VR enables full immersion - ability to take visitors to a different time and place
* VR has the ability to overcome physical constraints of galleries - being able to show objects at scale or bringing into life within context and placing them within a context.

I have been using the Oculus Rift in the lab and Google Cardboard as my hardware for testing out
the scenes. For moving around in the museum, I have used the Oculus Rift Touch controllers and
the Xbox controller.
All the demos and the project can be found at GitHub where I have posted them. The link to the
repository is: https://github.com/aiy-wish/Locomotion. After downloading the zip file, you can
extract the files to a desired folder of your choice and after launching unity, just open the file and
you will be able to see the museum after selecting the main scene under Assets →Scenes →
MainScene.unity
