# Virtual Reality Locomotion

Designed a VR application to educate Curators and Museum Directors on the benefits that VR/AR technology can bring to their exhibits. Mixed reality literally makes the possibilities endless and this application will guide the user through a small exhibit floor showcasing some of the capabilities and current-day applications of VR.

## Getting Started
Download the ZIP files and launch Unity to preview all assets and run the application. Just look at the ground where you want to go and click to dash forward. Red orbs identify stations that can be toggled on and off.

I have been using the Oculus Rift in the lab and Google Cardboard as my hardware for testing out
the scenes. For moving around in the museum, I have used the Oculus Rift Touch controllers and
the Xbox controller.
All the demos and the project can be found at GitHub where I have posted them. The link to the
repository is: https://github.com/aiy-wish/Locomotion. After downloading the zip file, you can
extract the files to a desired folder of your choice and after launching unity, just open the file and
you will be able to see the museum after selecting the main scene under Assets →Scenes →
MainScene.unity
